# Kirby - Notifier

**Version 0.0.1 / November, 23rd 2015 - intial public offering.**

Send an email to the admin, everytime a user has logged in to the panel.

****

### What is it?

Kirby Notifier is a simple plugin that notifies the sites administrator by mail, everytime an user has logged in to the panel.

The plugin works standalone and is inspired by the Wordpress' Wordfence plugin ( https://www.wordfence.com/ )

### Why is it?

It helps admins to keep an eye on their site-usage and it can warn them when someone logs under with aberrant circumstances.

### How to install?

1. Copy / paste the directory ```/site/plugins/notifier``` (and all of it's files) to your own Kirby-site.
2. Set some preferences in ```site/config/config.php``` (see ```_config.php``` for the basic settings).

  1. **kirbyNotifierEmail** - the email-address of the sites administrator
  2. **kirbyNotifierPanel** - the root-folder of Kirbies panel (defaults to ```panel```)
  3. **kirbyNotifierRemote** - whether or not the plugin is allowed to call a remote server *)

*) The remote server is called for detailed location information about the logged in user. No private data is send, only the users IP-address, which will return a longitude / langitude and country / city.

This Location-data is provided for free by http://www.hostip.info/ and http://www.geoplugin.com/ (no need to register, but can be helpfull).

### How does the email look like?
